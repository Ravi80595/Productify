here are the general steps to run a React app in your local system after cloning it from my repo:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download and install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you have cloned the React app repository.

Run the command npm install to install all the dependencies required for the app to run. This may take some time depending on the size of the app and the number of dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, run the command npm start to start the app. This will start a local development server and launch the app in your default web browser.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the app running in your browser. You can now make changes to the app code, save the changes, and the app will automatically update with the new changes in the browser.

That's it! These are the basic steps to run app in your local system after cloning it from a repo.




To integrate our app as an embedded app in a Shopify mock admin panel, we need to follow a few steps. First, we need to create a Shopify Partner account and create a new app in the Partner Dashboard. Then, we need to configure the app settings and generate the required API keys.

Once we have the API keys, we can use them to authenticate our app and make API calls to the Shopify store. To embed our app in the Shopify admin panel, we can use the Shopify App Bridge library, which provides a set of components and utilities for building embedded apps.

To use the Shopify App Bridge library, we need to install it in our React app using npm or yarn. Then, we can import the required components and use them to create the app interface and handle the API calls. Finally, we need to deploy our app to a secure server and add it as an embedded app in the Shopify Partner Dashboard.
