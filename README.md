here are the general steps to run a React app in your local system after cloning it from my repo:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download and install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you have cloned the React app repository.

Run the command npm install to install all the dependencies required for the app to run. This may take some time depending on the size of the app and the number of dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, run the command npm start to start the app. This will start a local development server and launch the app in your default web browser.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the app running in your browser. You can now make changes to the app code, save the changes, and the app will automatically update with the new changes in the browser.

That's it! These are the basic steps to run app in your local system after cloning it from a repo.
